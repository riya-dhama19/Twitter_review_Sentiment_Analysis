# Twitter_review_Sentiment_Analysis

Apply the logistic regression classification algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to classify Twitter reviews as either postive or negative.

## Objective :

1. Build and employ a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn.

2. Clean and pre-process text data.

3. Perform feature extraction with nltk

4. Evaluate model accuracy

## Structure:

### Task 1: Introduction and Importing the Data

* Introduction to the data set and the problem overview.

* Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

### Task 2: Transforming Documents into Feature Vectors

* Represent text data using the bag-of-words model from natural language processing and information retrieval.

* Construct the vocabulary of the bag-of-words model and transform the provided sample sentences into sparse feature vectors.

### Task 3 : Data Preparation

* Cleaning and pre-processing text data is a vital process in data analysis and especially in natural language processing tasks.

* Strip the data set of reviews of irrelevant characters including HTML tags, punctuation, and emojis using regular expressions.

### Task 4 : Spliting Dataset into Train and Test Set

### Task 5 : Document Classification using Logistic Regression

* Using Sikit-Learn importing function and applying to train and test set

* Predicting Values

* Checking Accuracy on train , test data

* Checking Metrics Performance
